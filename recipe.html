     <h2>How to Cook Omena for Ugali</h2>
     <p>There are different methods to cook Omena, as you will see, but one 
    thing is definite if you know how to make it, it will be all delicious.</p>

       <p> Here I will show you a few of the best and easiest methods to cook
         Omena. You can use the simplest way or go even more.</p>
        <h2>The omena stew</h2>
        I had to start with this method because it reminds me of my late grandma. She had this unique, delicious, and rich omena that my dad praises to date. Even non-omena lovers would enjoy this style of omena. Mind you; I rarely ate omena before this.
        
        I know the most common one is the dry-fried style of omena, but you can always make the stew. Any cooked omena style goes well with Ugali, but nothing beats the taste of the creamy stew with the ugali in your mouth.
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <p> Omena</p>
       <p>  tomatoes</p>
       <p> onions/spring onions</p>
       <p> milk/cream</p>
       <p> fish curry</p>
       <p> salt</p>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        This may be the easiest omena to make and yet the most delicious. Most people make it using the dry fry method these days, but you don’t have to if you like it with stew.
        
       <h3>Clean it</h3>
        Clean your omena. This includes checking that it doesn’t have dirt and debris before you wash it. I mean, washing it is just pouring in water to clean it. Set it in the saucepan, ready to cook.
        
       <h3>Boil it</h3>
        Now set it on fire the traditional way (3 stones fire) if you are cooking it the traditional way or just on your gas stove. Allow it to cook for 30-45 minutes. Traditionally, my grandma would let hers cook for up to 2 hours, and if you would like to do it the old ways, you’re welcome to try.
        
        I mean, there’s a difference in taste. But don’t cook it in the pressure cooker. It just spoils everything. I know someone may be tempted to set it in a pressure cooker. This is one of those meals we only cook the traditional way.
        
        Once ready, drain the remaining excess water into another bowl, as you will need it when frying again.
        
       <h3>Now fry it</h3> 
        When it’s ready, go to the next step, frying it.
        
        Prepare your veggies, onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers. If you like the spices, you will use salt and oil.
        
        Set a clean saucepan on the gas stove or fire, and then add olive oil to start the cooking.
        
        Next, add the onions and let it brown or cook to translucent. If you like, then you can add the garlic, although I don’t do so.
        
        Add in your tomatoes and let them cook down or soften. If you like can also puree it. Next, you can add your favorite spices or bell peppers if you want to add them.n Of course, each veggie has a distinctive taste, and even the bell peppers will make your omena much better.
        
        Now add the drained Omena and toss it in the mix of tomatoes. Finally, you can add the sauce from the boiled omena we drained. Give it time to cook; usually, about 10 minutes is fine. You can add cream or milk to finish the process for even more flavor.
        
         
        
        
        Traditionally, we served it with our favorite chili or cooked it in the stew. But of course, if there are kids who will enjoy the stew and don’t eat chili, skip it.
        
        <h2>METHOD 2</h2>
        Another common method to cook the omena is to wet fry it. Almost anyone you see on social media wet fries eat or dry fries it. This is the easiest as it takes less time than the other process.
        
        <h3>Clean the Omena</h3>
        Clean your omena to ensure you get rid of all the stones that may be present. And, of course, you can as well use similar ingredients. Next, wash it in cold water to clean out the debris.
        
        <h3> Add boiling water</h3>
        For this method, add boiling water to the omena and let it sit for about five minutes. Usually, we also sprinkle lemon into this water as its settles.
        
        Drain the excess water and then set it the omena aside. For this water, then, you will need to discard it.
        
       <h3> Fry it</h3>
        Now let’s fry it by adding the olive oil to the saucepan and then adding the omena to the saucepan to fry it. Keep tossing it for about five minutes. We want it to mix well with the oil. Mind you; though, we aren’t using a lot of oil.
        
        Now add the chopped onions. Allow it to be brown but keep tosing the omena to ensure it cooks right.
        
        Add your bell peppers and let them cook before you add the chopped tomatoes. Keep cooking it for a few minutes to allow the tomatoes to break. At this point, you can add in your favorite spice or then also add in the salt.
        
        Toss it more, and then serve it with your favorite Ugali and vegetables.</p>
